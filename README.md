### Structure of the repository

We include the following folders:
- `3dgs_optimization`: This folder contains the code we used to optimize the 3DGS for all the datasets.
- `preprocess_2d_vlm_embedding`: This folder contains the code we used to obtain the 2D VLM embeddings for a subset of the datasets.
- `gaussian_world_3d_semseg_benchmarks`: This folder contains the code we used to benchmark all the methods we reported.

Please refer to the README file of each subfolder for instructions.
